Methods are generally the block of codes or statements in a program that gives the user the ability to reuse the same code which ultimately saves the excessive use of memory, 
acts as a time saver and more importantly, it provides a better readability of code. So basically, a method is a collection of statements that perform some specific task and return the result to the caller. 
A method can also perform some specific task without returning anything.

In C# a method declaration consists of the following components as follows :

Modifier : It defines access type of the method i.e. from where it can be accessed in your application. In C# there are Public, Protected, Private access modifiers.  
Name of the Method : It describes the name of the user defined method by which the user calls it or refer it. Eg. GetName()
Return type: It defines the data type returned by the method. It depends upon user as it may also return void value i.e return nothing
Body of the Method : It refers to the line of code of tasks to be performed by the method during its execution. It is enclosed between braces.
Parameter list : Comma separated list of the input parameters are defined, preceded with their data type, within the enclosed parenthesis. If there are no parameters, then empty parentheses () have to use out. 

Method Signature : Method Signature is defined by mainly two parameters(number of parameters, type of the parameters and order of the parameters), One of them is Method Name and second one is its Parameter list.
Method Naming : Name of a method or a function in any programming language whether in C++ or Java or C# holds great importance and is mainly used in order to call that method for its execution.
 For example, findSum, computeMax, setX and getX etc.
